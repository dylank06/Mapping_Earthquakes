# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Summary 

The Leaflet.js API was used to populate a geographical map from a URL with GeoJSON earthquake info. Each earthquake is depicted visually by a circle and color, where a greater magnitude has a larger diameter and the color would be darker. Moreover, each earthquake has a pop-up marker that will indicate the magnitude of the earthquake and the location of the earthquake when pressed.
